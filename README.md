[VIEW PROJECT](https://festclax.github.io/Python/project1.ipynb)

This project is on the Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI) in different states in Nigeria. At the end of the analysis, investors will be able to make informed decision on which state and which sector to invest in for profit optimization whilst impacting and improving the standard of living of the people. The dataset was gotten from a study carried out by Oxford University as referenced by the website of Humanitarian Data Exchange.


# DATA CLEANING AND VISUALIZATION IN EXCEL

In this analysis, we looked at the state of Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) in Nigeria. Knowing that they are mostly in the northen part of the country, we focused our data analysis on the North East region of Nigeria. Unarguably, this is the part of the nation that has suffered most from insurgency, leading to most citizens there becoming IDPs. With this analysis, both local and international NGOs will know how to be of help.
